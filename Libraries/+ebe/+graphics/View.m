    % View summary of View
    %
    % A view is a collection of graphical output routines which are used to
    % provide information on an event generator or estimator. A SLAM
    % system, for example, needs to depict the estimated location of the
    % platform together with all the sensors. An event generator might want
    % to show the ground truth platform position together with the sensor
    % measurements at a given timestep.
